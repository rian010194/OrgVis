## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture Considerations

### Database Expansion
Most features will require new tables. Plan your schema carefully:
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Implement foreign key constraints
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data

### Frontend Architecture
Consider code organization as features grow:
- Modularize JavaScript files by feature
- Consider migrating to a framework (React, Vue) for complex features
- Implement state management (Redux, Zustand) for real-time features
- Use build tools (Webpack, Vite) for optimization

### API Design
When building APIs:
- Follow REST or GraphQL best practices
- Implement rate limiting and authentication
- Version your APIs (v1, v2) for backwards compatibility
- Document with OpenAPI/Swagger

### Performance Optimization
As data grows:
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Add caching layers (Redis)
- Optimize database queries with proper indexes
- Consider lazy loading for visualizations
